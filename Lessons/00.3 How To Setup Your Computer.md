<p>Web development doesn’t require too much special software, and you can even develop websites online without installing anything on your local machine.</p>
<p>For this course I am going to recommend that you use a set of tools. I will also give you a list of some alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="the-tool-kit">The Tool Kit</h3>
<p>We will be using four tools in this course: A web browser, a code editor, a terminal, and version control software.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For our web browser, we will use <strong>Google Chrome</strong>.<br>
You will need a web browser to run and test your code. Technically, you can use any browser, but for this course we will use the Chrome Developer tools.<br>
If you don’t have this already, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">https://www.google.com/chrome/</a> to download. After downloading, run the file to install.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For our code editor, we will use <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>.<br>
You need a text editor to write and edit your code. Technically, you could even use a simple text editor like notepad, but Visual Studio Code comes with lots of tools, making it one of the best and most popular options. To download visit <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a> and choose the link for your operating system. After downloading, run the file to install.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Visual Studio Code is highly customizable with <strong>extensions</strong>. There are a TON. It’s not so important which ones you use, but you definitely should find extensions to make your life easier. Here are some you may want to try.<br>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>For our terminal, we will use <strong>Git Bash</strong>.<br>
The terminal will let you run certain important commands and do certain tasks more quickly. To download visit To download visit <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">https://gitforwindows.org/</a> and choose the link for your operating system. and choose the link for your operating system. After downloading, run the file to install.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For version control, we will use <strong>GitHub</strong>.<br>
A version control system will let you save your code in the cloud. It will let you work on your project from multiple locations, and undo changes if you ever need to. Eventually, you can also have multiple people working together on a project.<br>
Go to <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> and create an account. Then, download the desktop application <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a>, and install. (You don’t need the desktop version, but it makes things easier, especially as a beginner to GitHub.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have all of these installed, your machine is ready for some serious web development!</p>
