<h3 id="what-css-does">What CSS Does</h3>
<p>Imagine you are a business owner looking to make a flyer and a brochure. You send your text and company images to a few graphic designers. Although each flyer and brochure contains the same basic elements, the styles are completely unique.</p>
<p>Imagine you are a real estate developer. You build a row of identical houses, and sell them. The walls are unpainted, the floors are unfinished, and there are no fixture, appliances, or furniture. Each buyer will choose their own color scheme, tiles, drapes, light fixture, etc. Although, the basic structure of each home is the same, the look and feel of each home will be completely different.</p>
<p>In a similar way, a web page made of basic HTML elements can be styled in many ways. These styles are defined in a <strong>stylesheet</strong>, written in a language known as <strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets—later we learn what is meant by “cascading”).</p>
<p>To appreciate how much <strong>CSS</strong> can change a page, it worth taking a look at a site called <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">http://www.csszengarden.com/</a>. Here the same page can be viewed styled using different <strong>CSS</strong> with wildly different results.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples.</p>

<h3 id="how-css-works">How CSS Works</h3>
<p>To understand how CSS works, first we need to remember that all code has three parts—input, process, output.</p>
<p>In the case of CSS, the three elements are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input</strong> — A “selector” for which HTML element to style.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong> — A list of styles to apply to that element.</li>
<li><strong>Output</strong> — The browser will draw that element with its style.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<p>Let’s say you want to make all of the text in a paragraph blue and centered, you would write the following CSS rule:</p>
<pre><code>p {  
    color:  blue;  
    text-align:  center;  
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want your <strong>h1</strong> header to be purple and aligned right, you would use this rule:</p>
<pre><code>h1 {
	text-align: right;
    color: purple;
}
</code></pre>
