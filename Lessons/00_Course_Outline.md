# 00 Web Development Course Outline

#### What to Expect
Welcome to Web Development for the Complete Beginner!

This course will teach you all of the **fundamental concepts** that you need to create beautiful websites and amazing interactive web apps.

You will get plenty of **practice assignments** so that you can master the skills you learn. I recommend practicing each concept around 10 times to really master it.

One of the most important concepts to internalize is that even the best web developers and programmers don't know everything. The world of technology is just too big and changes too fast. Instead,  experienced coders learn **how to find answers** and know enough to **understand** the information they find. Thankfully, the internet is full of quality resources. Along the way, we will point you to some of these resources. Sometimes, you will be asked to read a specific article or watch a video lesson. Other times, you will be challenged to find an answer online. This way, you will master the vital skill of **researching**.

Wishing you much success on your journey!
