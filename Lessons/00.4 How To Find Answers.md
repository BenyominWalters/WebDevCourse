<p>One of the most important skills you can learn as a web developer is how to find answers to questions online. Even the most experienced developers don’t know everything—not by a long shot! Instead, they know the fundamentals, they know where to look for answers, and they know enough to understand the answers they find.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best online resources for web development. You can also find tons of other great resources by googling.</p>
<p><em>Watch this video for a realistic perspective on the importance of looking things up, even for the most experience developers. This is REALLY important!!!</em></p>

</ul>
<h3 id="top-online-resources">Top Online Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> This website has explanations, examples, and tutorials for every web related concept. It is one of the best online resources, especially for beginners.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN (Mozilla Developer Network</a> This website is probably the best source for documentation. It is a little advanced, but as you progress you will find it a very useful resource.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> This is a website where people post questions and answers relating to coding. If you search Google for just about any code related question, you will find answers from stackoverflow. The advantage of these questions is that you will find troubleshooting for very specific issues. On the other hand, you need to filter the results to find what best suits your needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/">Reddit</a> Reddit is also a great place to post questions. It is less formal and more forgiving than posting questions on stackoverflow.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> Generally, if you search for anything in Google you will find lots of great resources. Get used to doing this! Many programmers would describe themselves as professional Googlers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there are tons of online resources, but I want to give you a sense of some of the best that you can reliably come back to again and again.</p>
