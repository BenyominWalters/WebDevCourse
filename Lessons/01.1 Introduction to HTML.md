<h3 id="what-html-does">What HTML Does</h3>
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s and it has formed the backbone of websites ever since.</p>
<p>Originally, HTML was created to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give people a way to format text on websites.</li>
<li>Give people a way to add hyperlinks to text on websites, so that one page could be linked to another.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Basically, HTML turns plain text like this…</strong></em></p>

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
<p><em><strong>…into formatted text, complete with headers, bold and italic text, and links to other pages, like this…</strong></em></p>

<h3 id="how-html-works">How HTML Works</h3>
<p>To understand how HTML works, first we need to remember that all code has three parts—input, process, output.</p>
<p>In the case of HTML, the three elements are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input</strong> — Some plain text, an a “tag” with instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong> — The text will be converted to a certain layout.</li>
<li><strong>Output</strong> — The browser will display formatted text, and media.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<p>Text can be made <strong>bold</strong> by surrounding it with a “b” tag.  For example, &lt;b&gt;This Is Important&lt;/b&gt; will become <strong>This Is Important!</strong>.</p>
<p>Text can be made <em>italic</em> by surrounding it with an “i” tag.  For example, &lt;i&gt;Emphasize Me!&lt;/i&gt; will become <em>Emphasize Me!</em>.</p>
<p>Notice that we surround the text we want to format with an <strong>opening</strong> and a <strong>closing</strong> tag. The opening tag contains the command surrounded by “angel brackets” <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> . The closing tag contains the same command, but with a forward slash, to indicate the end of the command , like this<code>&lt;/command&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>That’s really all there is to basic HTML. There are lists of commands, and each is placed opening and closing tags. Basically, anything you can do in Word to format a document is something you can do with HTML.</p>
